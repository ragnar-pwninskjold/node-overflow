		<td>Price-earnings Ratio</td>

		<td>This data point represents the price you pay for every $1 dollar in earnings. Most investors want this number to be low, meaning you aren't paying a lot to earn money</td>

		<td>Debt-to-Equity</td>

		<td id="roa">xxx</td>
		<td>This number defines how well a company uses its assets to make money. Like Return on Equity, you want this to be high - it means a company can do a lot with what it has</td>

	<tr>
		<td>Current Ratio</td>
		<td id="currentratio">xxx</td>
		<td>This data point shows you if a company can pay its short-term liabilities with the assets it has on hands. If this number is less than 0, a company has more short-term debts than short-term assets, which could be dangerous if something goes wrong </td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Asset Turnover Ratio</td>
		<td id="assetturnover">xxx</td>
		<td>This number is similar to Return on Assets. If it is higher, it means a company is good at using its assets to make more money</td>
